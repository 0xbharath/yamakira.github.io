Everyone these days have a home page or blog, this is my attempt at having a home page where I can aggregate notes on things I learn, workshops I run, CTF/bug writeups, code I write etc.

## Profile

I\'m a freelance pentester based out of Bangalore, India. I share love for open source in general, Linux, pentesting and programming in Python. I enjoy sharing things I know, I have run workshops at various locations ranging from local hackerspaces to remote schools in Ladakh.

Outside technical realm, I enjoy books, rain, camping, learning (spoken)languages, chocolates and old monk!
