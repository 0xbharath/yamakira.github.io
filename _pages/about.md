This is just my little corner of The Internet where I aggregate all the things I learn, stories I write, bugs I find and code I write.


## Profile

I\'m a Security engineer based out of Bangalore, India. I do security research for Appsecco. I share love for open source in general, Linux, offensive security and programming in Python. I'm passionate about learning , building and creating new things. I enjoy sharing things I know, I\'ve run workshops at various places in the past, ranging from local hackerspaces to remote schools in Ladakh.

Outside technical realm, I enjoy books, rain, hiking, camping, learning languages, chocolates and old monk! I\'ve hiked & biked extensively across India.

In general, I hope to strive towards a world where we value skills over papers, where we're passionate about building and creating things over making career and money.
